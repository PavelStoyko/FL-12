/*Task 2. Identify triangle type.
    App workflow:
1.	User input 3 numbers (a, b, c) for triangle sides length.
2.	Check type of inputs. If type of inputs ( a OR b OR c ) is: empty string, undefined -  show modal window with message ( input values should be ONLY numbers )
3.	Check values of input values. If one of the value ( a OR b OR c ) equal to 0 - show modal window with message ( A triangle must have 3 sides with a positive definite length )
4.	Check such triangle can exist. If it can’t exit show modal window with message -  ‘Triangle doesn’t exist’.
5.	If triangle exist check its type:
    ●	equivalent (every side is equal)
●	isosceles (two sides are equal)
●	scalene (no sides are equal)
6.	Use console.log to show result, variants:

-	If such triangle can’t exist: ‘Triangle doesn’t exist’
-	If triangle has three equal sides: ‘Equilateral triangle’
-	If triangle has two equal sides, third differs: ‘Isosceles triangle’
-	If triangle has three different sides: ‘Scalene triangle’
